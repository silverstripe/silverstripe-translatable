# IMPORTANT NOTE

Silverstripe Translatable is only compatible with Silverstripe CMS 3. [Silverstripe CMS 3 has entered limited support in June 2018](https://www.silverstripe.org/blog/update-on-silverstripe-5-x/). This means we'll only be fixing critical bugs and security issues for Silverstripe CMS 3 going forward. This applies to _Translatable_ as well.

[`silverstripe/fluent`](https://github.com/tractorcow-farm/silverstripe-fluent) is the recommended alternative for Silverstripe CMS 4.

### Translations

Translations of the natural language strings are managed through a
third party translation interface, transifex.com.
Newly added strings will be periodically uploaded there for translation,
and any new translations will be merged back to the project source code.

Please use [https://www.transifex.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-translatable/](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/silverstripe-translatable/) to contribute translations,
rather than sending pull requests with YAML files.

See the ["i18n" topic](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/3/developer_guides/i18n/) on doc.silverstripe.org for more details.
